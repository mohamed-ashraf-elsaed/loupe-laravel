# The STRANGER TEST: install this package the way a new user would — into a brand-new
# Laravel app — and assert the things that have actually broken for first-time users.
#
#   1. the widget renders for an authenticated user, and NOT for a guest;
#   2. a comment can be created and read back through the API;
#   3. /loupe/dashboard never returns a 5xx. A fresh Laravel 11+ app has no [login] route,
#      and the auth middleware used to throw "Route [login] not defined" — a 500 on step 4
#      of the installer's own instructions. That is the bug this test exists to prevent.
#
# It installs THIS working tree (via a Composer path repository), not Packagist, so a pull
# request cannot merge a first-run break. Needs network (composer create-project) and
# writes only to a temp directory; python3 is used for the file edits.
